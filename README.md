# Biocentral API

API packages for easy access to the functionality of the biocentral ecosystem.

## Supported languages

* ✅ [Python](/python)
* ✅ [Dart](/dart)

## Main Features

* **Embedding**: Embed protein sequences into a vector space using a protein language model.
* **Predict**: Predict protein properties using pre-defined prediction models.
* **Train**: Train your own custom prediction models (using [biotrainer](https://github.com/sacdallago/biotrainer))
* **Inference**: Run inference on new data using your own custom prediction models.
